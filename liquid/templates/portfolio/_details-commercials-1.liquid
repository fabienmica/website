        This commercial highlights the very place where the successful holidays and insurance company
        <strong>Saga</strong> started : a beautiful hotel in Folkestone.

        The business recreated a faithful 3D version of the hotel that could be relighted and rendered from any point of
        view and every wheater condition required by the story.

        The business captured HDR imagery for the
        <strong>Johnnie Walker</strong> commercial &quot;Where Flavour is King&quot; supporting VFX supervisor Colin
        Renshaw and director Mark Molloy during a three-day pre-shoot in Prague.
      </p>
      <p>
        We photographed three castles, producing 90 GB of bracketed exposures, which were automatically processed into
        EXR files using our in-house software Enwashot. Despite challenging lighting, the team delivered high-quality
        references, earning praise from Colin, who noted the photogrammetry stills were invaluable for textures and
        visual planning.
